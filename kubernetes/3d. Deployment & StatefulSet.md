## Deployment

A Deployment in Kubernetes is a higher-level object that manages Pods automatically.
It defines a blueprint (template) for Pods and ensures the desired number of them are always running.

Instead of creating Pods manually, you create a Deployment.
Kubernetes then:

- Creates Pods based on your template
- Monitors and restarts them if they crash
- Allows rolling updates and rollbacks without downtime

Basically:
ðŸ§± Pod = one running instance of your app
ðŸ“‹ Deployment = the plan or manager that controls those Pods

## StatefulSet

A StatefulSet in Kubernetes is a controller used to manage stateful applications â€” workloads that need stable, persistent storage and consistent network identities, such as databases (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB).

Unlike a Deployment, which treats all Pods as identical and replaceable, a StatefulSet ensures that:

- Each Pod has a unique, stable name (pod-0, pod-1, pod-2, etc.)
- Each Pod keeps its own persistent volume â€” so data is not lost when the Pod restarts
- Pods are started, updated, and terminated in order (important for clustered databases)

Thatâ€™s why you donâ€™t use a Deployment for databases â€” Deployments assume Pods are stateless and interchangeable, which can corrupt or duplicate data in databases.
