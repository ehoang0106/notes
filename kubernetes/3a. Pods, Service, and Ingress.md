## 1. Node and Pod

### Pod

A Pod is an abstraction over a container. So a pod is similar a container in docker but not exactly.

While container is a single running instance of an application, a Pod is the smallest deployable unit in Kubernetes, but it can contain one or more containers.
A Pod is like a wrapper around one or more containers.
In most simple cases, 1 Pod = 1 Container, so it feels like they’re the same.

Each Pod gets its own IP address and Pods are ephemeral (khong ben, khong lau).
When pod is crashed, a new pod will be created with a new IP address, therefore we need a SERVICE.
## 2. Service and Ingress

### Service

Service is a permanent IP address that can be attached to each pod.

A Service in Kubernetes is an abstraction that defines a stable network endpoint to access a set of Pods. It automatically handles load balancing and ensures that clients can reach the Pods even if their IP addresses change

### Ingress

Ingress in Kubernetes is an API object that manages external access to Services, typically HTTP and HTTPS traffic. It provides routing rules that map incoming requests (like URLs or domains) to the appropriate Service inside the cluster

Relation to Service:
- A Service exposes a group of Pods internally within the cluster.
- An Ingress acts as a gateway that routes external traffic (from outside the cluster) to those Services based on defined rules.

Think of it like this:
