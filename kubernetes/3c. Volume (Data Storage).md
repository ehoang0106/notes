A **Volume** in Kubernetes is a storage resource that allows data to **persist** across container restarts or be **shared** between containers in a Pod.

	Normally, data inside a container is **lost when the container restarts.
	A Volume solves that by mounting external storage into the Pod.

Just think that the storage is an external hard drive plugged in into the k8s cluster, it is not a part of k8s cluster but it is important.

*The storage can be on local machine or remote, outside of the K8s cluster

K8s **DOES NOT** manage any data persistent, therefore, you an k8s user or an administrator are responsible  for backing up the data replicating and managing it
