## Configuration

Each configuration file has 4 parts
1. **apiVersion**: tell k8s which version of the API to use
2. **kind**: specifies what type of objects it is (Pod, Deployment, Service, etc)
3. **metadata**: contains identifying information like name, namespace, labels, and annotations
4. **spec**: defines the desired **configuration or behavior** of that object

Example:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: my-pod
  labels:
    app: web
spec:
  containers:
    - name: nginx
      image: nginx:latest
```
