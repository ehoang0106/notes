Kubernetes cluster consists of 2 types of resources:
- The **Control Plane** coordinates the cluster
- **Nodes** are the workers that run applications

**Control Plane** is responsible for managing the cluster such as: scheduling applications, maintaining applications' desired state, scaling applications, and rolling out new updates.

	Control Planes manage the cluster and the nodes that are used to host the running applications

**A Node** is a VM or physical computer that serves as a worker machine in a Kubernetes cluster.
Each node has a ***Kubelet***. 

**Kubelet** is a agent for managing the node and communicating with the Kubernetes control plane.

A Kubernetes cluster that handles production traffic should have a minimum of 3 nodes.

When you deploy applications on Kubernetes, you tell the control plane to start the application containers. The control plane schedules the containers to run on the cluster's nodes
