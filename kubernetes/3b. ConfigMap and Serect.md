## ConfigMap

A **ConfigMap** in Kubernetes is an object that stores **non-sensitive configuration data** (like environment variables, config files, or settings) separately from the application code. So you don't have to rebuild the whole app and re-deployment

Here’s a simple example of a **ConfigMap** that stores a database connection URL:

`ConfigMap`:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: db-config
data:
  DATABASE_URL: "postgresql://db-user@db-service:5432/mydatabase"
```

`Pod`:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: app-pod
spec:
  containers:
    - name: web-app
      image: myapp:latest
      env:
        - name: DATABASE_URL
          valueFrom:
            configMapKeyRef:
              name: db-config
              key: DATABASE_URL
```

- The ConfigMap `db-config` holds the database connection endpoint.
- The Pod `app-pod` reads that value and sets it as the environment variable `DATABASE_URL` for the container.

So if you want to change the URL endpoint, you just change it in the `ConfigMap` 

	ConfigMap is for non-confidential data only.
	Therefore, Serect comes in place.
## Serect

A Secret in Kubernetes is an object used to store sensitive data — like passwords, API keys, or tokens — in a secure way.

It keeps confidential information separate from your code and ConfigMaps. Kubernetes stores Secrets in base64-encoded form, and they can be mounted into Pods as environment variables or files.
