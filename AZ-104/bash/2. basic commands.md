## mkdir: make directory

create folder
```bash
mkdir project
```

create a folder `aws` in the parent folder `projects`:

```bash
mkdir --parents project/aws
```

## rm: remove

remove files

```bash
rm bot.py
```

remove all the files in the current directory:

```bash
rm *
```

running `rm` with a `-i` flag lets you think before you delete:

```bash
rm -i *
```

remove subdirectory

```bash
rm -r projects
```

## cp: copy

make a copy of `001.jpg` with name `002.jpg`:

```bash
cp 001.jpg 002.jpg
```

if `002.jpg` is exists, bash will silently replaces it, therefore use  `-i` to warns you before delete

```bash
cp -i 001.jpg 002.jpg
```

can use wildcards to copy several files at once.  To copy all the files in the current dir to a subdir named `photos`:

```bash
bash * photos
```

copy all files in a subdirectory named `photos` into a subdirectory named `images`:

```bash
cp photos/* images
```

## ps: running process

`ps` gives a snapshot of all currently running processes.

list all running processes:

```bash
ps -e
```

more comprehensive:

```bash
ps -ef
```
