## bash I/O Operator

`<` : redirecting input to a source other than the keyboard
`>` : redirecting output to destination other than the screen
`>>` : doing the same, but appending rather than overwriting
`|` : piping output from one command to the input of another

Suppose you want to list everything in the current directory but capture the output in a file named **listing.txt**. The following command does just that:

```bash
ls > listing.txt
```

If **listing.txt** already exists, it gets overwritten. If you use the `>>` operator instead, the output from `ls` is appended to what's already in **listing.txt**:

```bash
ls >> listing.txt
```

piping `|` :

`more`

for ex:  list all the processes but once the screen is full, the output pause until hit `Enter`:

```bash
ps -ef | more
```

`head`
see several lines:

```bash
ps -ef | head
```

only contain the keyword you want:

```bash
ps -ef | grep daemon
```

`sort` sorts text in alphabetical order:

```bash
sort < file.txt
```

save the sorted
