### terraform fmt

- Formats Terraform code for readability
- Helps in keeping code consistent
- Safe to run at any time

Syntax: `terraform fmt`
Scenario:
- Before pushing your code to version control
- After upgrading Terraform or its modules
- Any time you've made changes to code

### terraform tain

- Taints a resource, forcing it to be destroyed and recreated
- Modifies the state file only, which cause the recreation workflow
- Tainting a resource may cause other resources to be modified

Syntax: `terraform tain RESOURCE_ADDRESS`
Scenario:
- To cause provisioners to run
- Replace misbehaving resources forcefully
- To mimic side effect of recreation not modeled by any attributes of the resource

### terraform import

- Maps existing resources to Terraform using an "ID"
- "ID" is dependent on the underlying vendor, for example to import an AWS EC2 instance you will need to provide its instance ID
- Importing the same resource to multiple Terraform resources can cause unknow behavior and is not recommended
Syntax: `terraform import Resource_Address ID`
Scenario:
- When you need to work with existing resources
- Not allowed to create new resources
- When you're not in control of creation process of infrastructure
