## Debugging

- `TF_LOG` is an environment variable for enabling verbose logging in Terraform. By default, it will send logs to `stderr` (standard error output)
- Can be set to the following levels: `TRACE`, `DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARN`, `ERROR`
- `TRACE` is a most verbose level of logging and most reliable one
- To persist logged output, use the `TF_LOG_PATH` environment variable
- Setting logging environment variables for Terraform on Linux:
`export TF_LOG=TRACE`
`export TF_LOG_PATH=./terraform.log`
