There are 2 types of provisioners: `Creation-time` and `Destroy-time`

**Best practice**: 
- Provisioners are recommended for use when you want to invoke actions not covered by Terraform declarative model
- If the command within the provisioners returns non-zero code, it's considered failed

### Terraform Provisioners example

```js
	resource "null_resource" "dummy_resource" {
		provisioner "local-exec" {
			command = "echo '0' > status.txt"
		}
		provisioner "local-exec" {
			when = "destroy"
			command = "echo '1' > status.txt"
		}
	}
```
