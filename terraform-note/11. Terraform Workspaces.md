## Terraform Workspaces (CLI)

- The Terraform Workspaces are alternate state files within the same working directory
- Terraform starts with a single workspace that is always called `default`. It cannot be deleted

Subcommand:
`terraform workspace new <WORKSPACE_NAME>`: Create a workspace
`terraform workspace seelect <WORKSPACE_NAME>`: Select a workspace

Scenario:
- Test changes using a parallel, distinct copy of infrastructure `${terraform.workspace}`
- It can be modeled against branches in version control such as Git
