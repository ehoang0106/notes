## Layer 4 Load Balancing

### Request received

After the load balancer receives a connection request, it selects a target from the target group for the default rule
- **It attempts to open a TCP connection to the selected target on the port specified in the listener configuration**
### Listeners

- The listener on a Network Load Balancer then forwards the request to the target group. **There are no rule, unlike with Application LB**
### Target group

- Same as Application LB

## Ports and Protocols

- **Protocols**: TCP, TLS, UDP, TCP_UDP
- **Ports**: 1-65535

## Encryption

You can use a TLS listener to offload the work of encryption and decryption to your load balancer so your applications can focus on their business logic


## Exam tips

### Use cases

Network Load balancers are **best suited for load balancing of TCP traffic** where extreme performance is required. Operating at the connection level (Layer 4). Network LB can handle millions of requests per second while maintaining ultra-low latencies
- Network LB operate at layer 4
- Use where you need extreme performance
- Other use cases are where you need protocols not supported by Application load balancers
- Network LB can decrypt traffic, but you need install certificate
