## Layer 7 Load Balancing

After the load balancer receives a request, it evaluates the **listener** riles in priority order to determine which rule to apply, then select a target from the target group for the rule action

### Listener

A listener checks for connection request from clients, using the protocol and port you configure.
- **You define rules that determine how the load balancer routes request**
- **Each rule consists of priority, one or more actions, and one or more conditions**

### Rules

When conditions for a rule are met, then its actions are performed.
- You must define a default rule for each listener, and you can **optionally define addtional rules**
### Target groups

Each target group routes requests to one or more registered target, such as EC2, using protocol and port you specific

## Path-based routing

Remember that application load balancers are layer 7 aware and you can do intelligent-routing based on your paths, and to do that, you just need to enable path pattern

## HTTPS Load Balancing

To use HTTPS listener, you must deploy at least one SSL/TLS server certificate on your load balancer.
## Exam tips

- Application load balancers only support HTTP and HTTPS
- **Listener**: A listener checks for connection requests from clients, using the protocol and port you configure
- **Rules**: Determine how the load balancer routes request to its registered targets. Each rule consist of a priority, one or more actions, and one or more conditions
- **Target groups:** Each target group routes requests to one or more registered target, such as EC2, using protocol and port you specify
