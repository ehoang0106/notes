[[ELB]]

- Classic LB are the legacy load balancer.
- You can load balance HTTP/HTTPS applications and use layer 7-specific features, such as x-forwarded and sticky sessions. 
- You can also use strict Layer 4 load balancing for applications that rely purely on TCP protocol

## X-Forwarded-For

When traffic is sent from a load balancer, the server access logs contain the IP address of the proxy or load balancer only.
- **To see the original IP address of the client, the x-forwarded-for** request header is used

## Gateway timeouts

If your application stops responding, the classic LB responds with a 504 error
- This mean the application is having issues. This could be server or database

## Exam tips

- A 504 error means the gateway has timed out
- Troubleshoot the application: Is it the web server or database server?
- Need the IPv4 addresses of your end user? X-forwarded-for header
