### 4 facts about DynamoDB
- Stored on SSD storage
- Spread across 3 geographically distinct data centers
- Eventually consistent reads (default)

***Strongly consistent reads***: A strongly consistent read returns a result that reflects all writes that received a successful response prior to the read.
