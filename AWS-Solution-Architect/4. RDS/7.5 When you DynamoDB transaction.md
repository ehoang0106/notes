ACID for database
**ACID** is stand for ATOMIC, Consistent, Isolated and Durable

**ATOMIC**: All changes to the data must be performed successfully or not at all
**Consistent**: Data must be in consistent state before and after the transaction
**Isolated**: No other process can change the data while the transaction is running
**Durable**: The changes made by a transaction must persist

## Exam Tips

- You can use ACID with DynamoDB

- DynamoDB transactions provide developer ACID across 1 or more tables within a single AWS account and region

- You can use transactions when building applications that require coordinated inserts, deletes, or, updates to multiple items as part of a single logical business operation

- ACID basically means all or nothing. All: transaction succeeds across 1 or more tables. Nothing: Transaction fails.

Use cases for DynamoDB transactions:
- Processing financial transactions
- Fulfilling and managing orders
- Building multiplayer game engines
- Coordinating actions across distributed components and services

### Scenario:
- If you see any scenario question that mentions ACID requirements, think DynamoDB transactions
- DynamoDB transactions provide developers ACID across 1 or more tables within a single AWS account and region
- All-or-nothing transactions
