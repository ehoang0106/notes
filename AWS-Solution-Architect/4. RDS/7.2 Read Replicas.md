[[RDS]]
- A read replica is a read-only copy of your primary database. It's great for read-heavy workloads and takes the load off your primary database
- A read replica can be cross AZ or cross region
- Each replica has its own DNS endpoint
 - Read replica can be promoted to be their own databases. This will break the replication

### Key Facts

1. Scaling Read Performance: Primarily used for scaling, not for disaster recovery
2. Requires automatic backup
3. Multiple read replicas are supported: MySQL, MariaDB, PostgreSQL, Oracle, and SQL server allow you to add up to 5 read replicas to each DB Instance

## Exam tips

Multi-AZ vs Read Replica
### Multi-AZ

- An exact copy of your production database in another AZ
- Used for disaster recovery
- In the event of failure, RDS will automatically fail over to the standby instance

### Read Replica

- A read-only of your primary database in the same AZ, cross-AZ or cross-region
- Used to increase or scale read performance
- Great for read-heavy workloads and takes the load off your primary database for read-only workloads
