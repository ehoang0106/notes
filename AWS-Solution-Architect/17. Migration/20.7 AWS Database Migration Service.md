## Database Migration Service

3 different migrations
- Full load: All existing data is moved from sources to targets in parallel
- Full Load and Change Data Capture (CDC): Full load plus CDC captures changes to source tables during migration
- CDC only: Only replicate the data changes from the source database

# Exam Tips
- Allow migration of relational database, NoSQL database, data warehouses, and other data to AWS
- DMS server runs replication software that executes specified task
- Known the difference between full-load, fill load with CDC, and CDC-only migration
- One of the endpoints must be in AWS. Cannot leverage this for external
- SCT allows to convert databases schemas to a new or different target database schema
- Can migrate massive databases to AWS by using Snowball devices with DMS
