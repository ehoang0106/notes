# Exam Tips

- Any temp credentials are mentioned, scan the answer looking for roles
- Always preferred to create cross-account roles instead of IAM users
- Use roles everywhere instead of users
- Any temporary employees should get role access only. Avoid permanent credentials
- Role assumption is temporary (credentials expire)
