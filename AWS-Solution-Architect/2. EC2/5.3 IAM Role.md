#### IAM Role

**IAM Role**: A role is an identity you can create in IAM that has specific permissions. A role is similar to a user, as it is an AWS identity with permission policies that determine what the identity can and cannot do in AWS.

#### Roles are temporary

A role does not have standard long-term credentials the same way password or access keys do. Instead, when you assume a ole, it provides you with temporary security credentials for your role session.

Role can be assumed by people, AWS architecture, or other system-level accounts

Role can allow cross-account access. This allows one AWS account the ability to interact with resources in other AWS accounts

#### When using role?

1. **The preferred option**: Roles are preferred from a security perspective
2. **Avoid hard-coding your credentials**: Roles allow you to provide access without the use of access key IDs and secret access keys
3. **Policies**: Policies control a role's permissions
4. **Updates**: You can update a policy attached to a role, and it will take immediate effect
5. **Attaching and Detaching**: You can attach and detach roles to running EC2 instances without having to stop or terminate those instances
