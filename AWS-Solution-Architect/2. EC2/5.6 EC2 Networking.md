[[EC2]]
There are 3 different types of virtual networking cards in EC2 instances:
## ENI (Elastic Network Interface): 

For basic, day-to-day networking

AN ENI is simply a virtual network card that allows: Private/Public IPv4 address, many IPv6 address, MAC address, 1 or more security groups

ENI uses cases:
- Create a management network
- Use network and security appliances in your VPC
- Create dual-homed instances with workloads/roles on distinct subnets
- Create a low-budget, high-availability solution

*Creating a new instance EIN is default attached into it*
## EN (Enhanced Networking)

Uses single root I/O virtualization (SR-IOV) to provide high performance
EN for high-performance networking between 10 Gbps - 100 Gbps

## EFA (Elastic Fabric Adapter):

Accelerates high performance computing (HPC) and machine learning applications or if you need to do an OS-bypass. If you see a scenario question mentioning HPC or ML and asking what network adapter you want, choose EFA
