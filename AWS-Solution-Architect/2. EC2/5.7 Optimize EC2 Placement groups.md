There are 3 types of placement groups
## Cluster

A grouping of instances within a single AZ. Recommended for applications that need low network latency, high network throughput, or both

*Fact: Only certain instance types can be launched into cluster placement group*

## Spread

is a group of instances that are each placed on distinct underlying hardware. Spread placement groups are recommended for applications that have a small number of critical instances that should be kept separate from each other

## Partition

Each partition placement group has its own set of racks. Each rack has its own network and power source. No tow partitions within a placement group share the same racks, allowing you to isolate the impact of hardware failure within your application

## Exam tips

- A cluster placement group can't span multiple AZ, whereas a spread placement group and partition placement group can
- Only **certain types of instances** can be launched in a placement group (compute optimized, GPU, memory optimized, storage optimized)
- **AWS recommends homogenous instances** within cluster placement groups
- **You can't merge placement groups**
- You can **move an existing instance into a placement group**. Before you move the instance, the instance must be in the stopped state. You can move or remove an instance using the AWS CLI or AWS SDK, but you can't do it via the console yet
