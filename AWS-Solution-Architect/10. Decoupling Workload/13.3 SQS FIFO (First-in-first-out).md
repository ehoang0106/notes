[[Decoupling]], [[SQS]] 

### SQS messaging ordering

| Standard vs.                             | FIFO                        |
| :--------------------------------------- | :-------------------------- |
| Best-effort ordering                     | Guaranteed ordering         |
| Duplicate messages                       | No messge duplication       |
| Nearly unlimited transactions per second | 300 transactions per second |

### FIFO High throughput

- Process up to 9,000 transaction per second, per API action without batching
- Up to 90,000 messages per second by using batching APIs

# Exam Tips

- If see scenario talking about message ordering, scan for answers that include FIFO
- FIFO don't have the same performance as standard queues even can enable some feature to make performance more efficient
- You can order messages with SQS standard, but it's on you to do it
- Message deduplication ID is token used for deduplication of sent message. Matching deduplication IDs are not delivered during deduplication interval
- Message group id helps ensure messages are processed 1 by 1 in a strict order based on the group
- FIFO Queue cost more
