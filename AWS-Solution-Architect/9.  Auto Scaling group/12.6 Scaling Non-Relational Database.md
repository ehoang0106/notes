[[Scaling]],  [[RDS]]

## Scaling Options: 

### DynamoDB

Scaling is simplified when using DynamoDB, as AWS does all the heavy lifting

#### Provisioned scaling

- **Use case**: Generally predictable workload
- **Effort to Use:** Need to review past usage to set upper and lower scaling bounds
- **Cost**: Most cost-effective model

#### On-Demand Scaling

- **Use case:** Sporadic (Unusually) workload
- **Effort to Use**: Simply select on-demand
- **Cost**: Pay small amount of money per read and write. Less cost effective


### Capacity Units

#### Read Capacity Unit (RCU)

This is a DynamoDB unit of measurement for **reads per second for an item up to 4 KB in size**
#### Write Capacity Unit (WCU)

This is a DynamoDB unit of measurement for **writes per second for an item up to 1 KB in size**

# Exam Tip

- **Access Patterns:**: Know if your access patterns are predicable or unpredictable
- **Design Matters:** Avoid hot keys will also lead to better performance
- **Switching**: You can switch, but only twice per 24 hours per table
- **Cost**: Keep cost in mind when considering on provisioned or on-demand type
