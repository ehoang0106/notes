In the event of failure, at what point in time do you want your data recovered? Put simply, how much data can you afford to lose? 40 hours? 12 hours? Minutes? Seconds?

-> Typically speaking, the lower the time, the greater the cost. The lower RPO, the lower the cost

## Recovery Time Object (RTO)

In the event of a failure, how fast do you want to fail over/ How much time can the business afford? 

-> The lower the time, the more expensive the cost
