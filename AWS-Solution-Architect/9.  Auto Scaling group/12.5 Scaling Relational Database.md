[[Scaling]], [[RDS]]

## 4 ways to scale RD

**Vertical Scaling**: Resizing the DB from one size to another can create greater performance but require more cost.

**Scaling Storage:** Storage can be resized, but it's only able to go up, **not down**

**Read replicas**: Creating read-only copies of your data can help spread out the workload. cannot be used for any data that for writing purposes. This also cannot count as a failover instance 

**Aurora Serverless**: We can offload scaling to AWS. Excels with unpredictable workloads


# Exam Tip

## Scaling vs Refactoring

You'll be given scenarios and, unless otherwise specified, **refactoring and changing to DynamoDB is viable scaling choice**

-> It won't work that easily in the real world, but in the exam, **switching database types** can solve the problem.

### RD Scaling
- **Read replicas**: Read-heavy workload = Read replicas
- **Careful with Storage**: RDS storage only scales up - won't scale down
- **Vertical Scaling**: Don't be afraid of this scaling
- **Multi-AZ**: Unless it's a dev environment, turn this on. Remember that Standby instances cannot be directly used. Multi-AZ cluster DB deployment deploy HA reader instances, which can be used for read operations
- **Aurora Everything**: Whenever possible. try to use Aurora if the situation calls for a relational database
