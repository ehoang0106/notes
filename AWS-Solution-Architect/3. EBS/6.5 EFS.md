[[EBS]] [[EFS]]
EFS is expensive
## Exam tips
- EFS (Elastic File System) supports the NFSv4 (network file systems version 4) protocol
- Only pay for the storage you use 
- Can scale up to petabytes
- Can support thousands of concurrent NFS connections
- Data is stored across multiple AZs within region
- Read-after-write consistency

If you have a scenario-based question around `highly scalable shared storage using NFS`, think EFS
