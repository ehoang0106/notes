[[EBS]]
- Volumes are simply virtual hard disks.
- You need a minimum of 1 volume per EC2. This is called the root device volume


## Exam tips

- Volumes exist on EBS, whereas snapshots exist on S3.
- Snapshots are point-in-time photographs of volumes and are incremental in nature
- The first snapshot will take some time to create. For consistent snapshots, stop the instance and detach the volume
- You can share snapshots between AWS accounts as well as between regions, but first you need to copy that snapshot to the target region
- You can resize EBS volumes on fly as well as change volume type


You can move EC2 around the world. 

All you need to do is first `take a snapshot` 
-> `create a copy of a snapshot` then change the region desired that you want of the snapshot
-> Switch to that region, once that snapshot is in that region 
-> Create an image then launch EC2 from that image
