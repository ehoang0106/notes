[[EBS]] [[EC2]]
An Amazon Machine Image (AMI) provides the information required to launch an instance.
***You must be specify an AMI when you launch an instance***


## Exam tips

- Instance store volumes are sometimes called ephemeral storage
- Instance store volumes **cannot be stopped**. If underlying host fails, you will lose your data
- EBS-backed instances can be stopped. You will not lose the data on the instance if it stopped
- You can reboot both EBS and instance store volumes and you will not lose your data
- By default, both root volumes will be deleted on termination. However, with EBS, you can tell AWS to keep the root device volume.
