Encrypted volumes:
- Data at rest is encrypted inside the volume
- All data in flight moving between the instance and the volume is encrypted
- All snapshots are encrypted
- All volumes created from the snapshot are encrypted

**4 steps to encrypt an unencrypted volume**
- Create a snapshot of the unencrypted root device volume
- Create a copy of the snapshot and select the encrypt option
- Create an image in AMI from the encrypted snapshot
- Use that AMI to launch new encrypted instances
