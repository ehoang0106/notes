## CloudFormation

### Process overview

**Step 1**
- Write your code
- Declarative programming language that supports either JSON or YAML formatting.

**Step 2*
- Deploy your code as Stack or Stack Set.
- CloudFormation will go through the process of making the needed AWS API calls on your behalf.


Example:
```json
AWS TemplateFormatVersion: 2010-09-09
Resources:
	InternetGateWay:
		Type: 'AWS::EC2::InternetGateway'
		Properties:
			Tags:
			
```

### Using CloudFormation

#### Infrastructure as Code
Allows to leverage version control for all supported AWS infrastructure resources
#### Cost Tracking
Leverage stack tags in order to identify resources and their cost
#### Automated Deployment
No more having to manually stand up resources. Deploy and destroy them automatically via a template
#### Stacks Are Regional
Each stack deploy is a regional resources. Deploy portable stacks into other regions as needed
#### Change Sets
You can generate a preview of resources changes when updating an existing stack
#### Stack Sets
Use an admin account to create, update, or delete stacks across multiple accounts and Regions with a single operation

## Template Sections to Know

***Important to know the required template***

- **Required**: Resources

- **Optional**: AWSTemplateFormatVersion, Parameters, Mappings, Outputs, Transform

# Exam Tips

- CloudFormation is perfect for creating immutable architecture
- Know the layout of CloudFormation template and what sections do
- If it finds an error, CloudFormation rolls back based on your configuration
- CloudFormation can easily create an destroy your entire architecture
- Hard-coded values and resources IDs can be the reason templates fail to create
- CloudFormation makes the same API calls you make manually
