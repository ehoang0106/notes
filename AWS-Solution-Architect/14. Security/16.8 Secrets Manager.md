# Exam Tips

- SM can be used to securely store your application secrets: database credentials, API keys, SSH keys, passwords, etc.
- Application use the SM API to interact
- Rotating credentials is super easy - but be careful.
- When enabled, SM will rotate credentials immediately
- Make sure all application instances are configured to use SM before enabling credential rotation

#### Parameter store vs Secrets Manager

Parameter store is free and do not have key rotation
SM is cost but do have key rotation

If you need to save cost -> parameter
If you need more than 10,000 parameters, key rotation or the ability to generate password using CloudFormation -> SM
