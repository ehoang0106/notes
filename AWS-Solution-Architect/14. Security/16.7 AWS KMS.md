## KMS

- AWS KMS (key management service) is a managed service to create and control the encryption keys used to encrypt data

## Integration

- Integrated with other AWS services - such as EBS, S3, and RDS

## CMK

- A customer master key (CMK) is logical representation of a master key. The CMK include s metadata, such as the key ID, creation date, description, and key state
- CMK contains the key material used to encrypt and decrypt data

## HSM

Hardware security module (HSM) is a physical computing device that safeguards and manages digital keys and performs encryption and decryption functions

### KMS vs. CloudHSM

**KMS**
- Shared tenancy of underlying hardware
- Automatic key rotation
- Automatic key generation

**CloudHSM**
- Dedicated physical HSM to you
- Full control of underlying hardware
- Full control of users, group, keys, etc.
- No automatic key rotation



# Exam Tips

- AWS KMS is a managed service that makes it easy for you to create and control the encryption keys used to encrypt data
- Start using the service by requesting the creation of CMK: We control the lifecycle of the CMK as well as who can use or manage it

## 3 Ways to Generate a CMK

- AWS creates the CMK for us. The key material for CMK is generated within hardware security modules (HSMs) managed by AWS KMS
- Import key material from your own key management infrastructure and associate it with a CMK
- Have the key material generated and used in an AWS CloudHSM cluster as part of the custom key store feature in AWS KMS

## 3 Ways to Control Permission
- Use the key policy
- Use IAM policies in combination with the key policy
- Use grants in combination with the key policy
