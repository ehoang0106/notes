## Cognito

- Cognito provides authentication, authorization, and user management for web and mobile apps in a single service without the need for custom code.
- Users can sign in directly with username and password they create or through a third party (FB, Amazon, Google, Apple)

# Exam Tips

- User pool: User directories that provide sign-up and sign-in options for user of your application
- Identity pool: Allows users to access other AWS services
- You can use identity pool and user pool separately or together

### Cognito Sequence

You got a device, you're connecting to Cognito to a user pool, you're authenticating and getting a token. Then you are taking that token and sending it to an identity pool. And that identity pool will then give you AWS credentials. And use that credentials to access S3 or DynamoDB

1. Authenticate and get tokens
2. Exchange tokens and get AWS credentials
3. Access AWS services using credentials
