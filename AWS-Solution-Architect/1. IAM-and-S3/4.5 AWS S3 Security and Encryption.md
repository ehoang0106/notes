### The basics

Encryption in transit is achieved by **SSL/TLS**

Encryption at Rest (Server Side) is achieved by:
- S3 managed keys - SSE-S3 (Amazon will manage for us and manage all the key). Enabled by default.
- AWS Key Management Service, Managed Keys - SSE-KMS (This is where we and Amazon managed the keys together)
- Server Side Encryption with Customer provided Keys - SSE-C (Give Amazon our own key that we manage and we can encrypt S3 object then upload to S3)

### Exam Tips for Encryption

#### 1.  Encryption in Transit
- SSL/TLS
- HTTPS
#### 2. Client-Side Encryption

You encrypt the files yourself before upload them to S3.

#### 3. Encryption at Rest: SSE

- Server-side encryptions
- SSE-S3 (AES 256-bit)
- SSE-KMS
- SSE-C
#### 4. Enforcing Encryption with a Bucket Policy

A bucket policy can deny all **PUT** requests that don't include `x-amz-server-side-encryption` parameter in the request header.


### Versioning

- Stores all versions of an object (including all writes and even if you delete an object)
- Great backup tool
- Once enabled, Versioning cannot be disabled, only suspended.
- Integrates with Lifecycle rules
- Versioning's **MFA Delete** capability.

Versioning stores all versions of an object, including any rights, even we delete the object, it's going to place a delete marker over that object, but the versions that existed before it will exist
