## S3 Prefixes Explained

`mybucketname/folder1/subfolder1/myfiles.jpg` > prefix: `folder1/subfolder1`
`mybucketname/folder2/subfolder1/myfiles.jpg` > prefix: `folder2/subfolder1`
`mybucketname/folder1/folder2/folder3/folder4/subfolder1/myfiles.jpg` > prefix: `folder1/folder2/folder3/folder4/subfolder1`


=> Prefix doesn't include the object name and file type. It's literally just the folders within the bucket.

## S3 Performance

S3 has extremely low latency. You can get first byte out of S3 within 100-200 milliseconds.
You can also achieve a high number of request:
**3,500 PUT/COPY/POST/DELETE** and **5,500 GET/HEAD** requests per second, prefix.

Get better performance:

1. You can get better performance by spreading your reads across different prefixes. For example, if you are using **2 prefixes**, you can achieve **11,000 request per second**
2.  If we used all 4 prefixes in the last example, you would achieve **22,000 request per second**

**Keys**: The more folder and subfolder you have in the bucket, the better performance you got.

### S3 Limitations when using KMS

- If you are using **SSE-KMS** to encrypt your objects in S3, you must keep in mind the KMS limits.
- When you upload a file, you will call `GenerateDataKey` in the KMS API.
- When you download a file, you will call `Decrypt` in the KMS API

#### S3 Performance: Uploads

##### Multipart Uploads
- Recommended for files **over 100 MB**
- Required for files **over 5 GB**
- Parallelize uploads (increase efficiency)
If you were asked for how you can get a better performance doing uploads, think about multipart uploads (We have big files -> Split into parts -> Parallel uploads)

##### Byte-Range Fetches
- Parallelize downloads by specifying byte ranges.
- If there's a failure in the download, it's only for a specific byte range.
