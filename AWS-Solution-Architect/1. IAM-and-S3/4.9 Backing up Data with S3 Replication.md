## S3 Replication

- Replicate objects from one bucket to another. Versioning must be enabled on both the source and destination buckets.

- Objects in an existing bucket are not replicated automatically. We have to go in and create a batch job.

- Delete markers are not replicated by default. Deleting individual versions or delete markers will not be replicated.
