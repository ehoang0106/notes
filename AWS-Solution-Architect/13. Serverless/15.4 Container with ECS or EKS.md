[[Serverless]], [[Container]]

## Amazon ECS

Amazon Elastic Container service is a service that allows you to easily launch and manage Docker containers running on AWS compute

## Why ECS?

- Manage anywhere from 1 to thousands of containers
- Will place the containers and keep them online
- Registered with chosen load balancers as they come online and go offline
- Can have individual roles attached to them, making security a breeze
- Easy to set up and scale to handle any workload

## Other container Orchestration (phoi hop)

- Kubernetes save the day!
- Open-source alternative
- Can be used on-prem and cloud
- AWS-managed version is called Elastic Kubernetes service (EKS)

### ECS vs EKS

#### ECS
- Proprietary AWS container management solution
- Best used when you are all in on AWS (that's mean not open source)
- You are looking for something simple to orchestrate containers 

#### EKS
- AWS-managed version of open-source Kubernetes container management solution
- Best used when you are not all in on AWS
- Signification more work to configure and integrate with AWS

# Exam Tips

- Simple container service for deploying and managing Docker containers
- If you see containers mentioned, you should think ECS
- Generally, favor using AWS-designed services over third party
- Anytime see open source for Kubernetes, think EKS
- Great for long-running applications
