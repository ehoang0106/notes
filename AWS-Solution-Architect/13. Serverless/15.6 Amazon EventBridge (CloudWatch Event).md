# Amazon EventBridge

- Amazon EventBridge (formerly CloudWatch Events) is a serverless event bus.
- Allows you to pass events from a source to an endpoint. Essentially, it's the glue that holds your serverless application together
## EventBridge Concept

- **Events**: A recorded change in an AWS environment, SaaS partner, or one of your own configured applications/services. This also includes scheduled events
- **Rules**: Criteria used to match incoming events and send them to the appropriate targets. Based on either event patterns or schedules
- **Event Bus**: A router that receives events and delivers them to targets. Every account has a default bus, and can create other custom buses
