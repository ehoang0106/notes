[[Serverless]], [[Lambda]]

# AWS Lambda

Lambda is a serverless compute services lets you run code without provisioning or managing the servers.
Run the code on demand with automated scaling

## Lambda Features

- Pricing: Free tier of 1M request and 400K GBs of compute per month
- Integrations: S3, DynamoDB, EventBridge, SQS/SNS, Kinesis
- Built-in Monitoring: Logging and monitoring can be easily accomplished using CloudWatch
- Easy configuration: Easily set memory requirements as needed. Can use up to 10,240 MB
- Execution Length: Used for short-term executions. Time limit 15 mins. For longer, use ECS, Batch or EC2
- Runtime support: Python, Golang, Node.js, etc.

## Building a Function

### Lambda Configuration

- **Run time**: You need to pick from an available or bring your own. This is the environment your code will run in
- **Permissions:** If Lambda functions needs to make an AWS API call, you'll need to attach a AIM role
- **Networking**: Optionally define the VPC, subnet, and security groups your functions are a part of
- **Resources**: Define amount of available memory allocated to your function
- **Trigger:** What's going to alert your Lambda function to start? Defining a trigger will kick Lambda off if that event occurs

### Lambda Function Quotas

#### Compute and Storage
- 1,000 concurrent executions 512 MB - 10 GB disk storage (/tmp)
- Integration with EFS if needed
- 4 KB for all environment variables
- 128 MB - 10 GB memory allocation
- Can run for up to 900 sec (15 min)
#### Deployments and Configuration
- Compressed deployment package (.zip) < 50 MB
- Uncompressed deployment package < 250 MB
- Request and response payload sizes up to 6 MB
- Streamed responses up to 20 MB

# Exam Tips

- Scenarios involving automating operations task will likely include Lambda
- Know the limitation and general use cases for Lambda
- Be familiar with the different triggers that can invoke Lambda function: S3, SQS/SNS, HTTP request, Amazon EventBridge
- Lambda excels in running small, short, and lightweight functions
- Easily integrated
- Lambda can run inside or outside a VPC (default)
