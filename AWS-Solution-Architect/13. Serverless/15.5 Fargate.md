[[Serverless]]

# AWS Fargate

- Fargate is a serverless compute engine for docker containers
- AWS owns and manages the infrastructures
- Required use of ECS or EKS
- Can use both Linux and Windows

## EC2 vs Fargate

### EC2
- Responsible for underlying operating system
- EC2 pricing model
- Long-running containers
- Multiple containers can share the same host
- Capable of mounting EFS file systems for persistent, shared storage

### Fargate
- No operating system access
- Pay based on resources allocated and time ran
- Short-running tasks
- Isolated environments per container
- Capable of mounting EFS file systems for persistent, shared storage

## Fargate vs Lambda

### Fargate
- Select fargate when have more consistent workloads
- Allows Docker use across the organization and greater level of control by developers
### Lambda
- Great for unpredictable or inconsistent workloads
- Perfect for applications that can be expressed as a single function


# Exam Tips

- You need to know when to choose Fargate compared to Lambda or EC2
- Serverless compute option via ECS
- ECS or EKS is requirement, meaning Fargate doesn't work by itself
- Fargate can be more expensive, but easier to use, compared to the EC2 launch type
- Fargate is for containers and applications that need to run longer
- You leverage ECS task roles for assigning IAM permissions to the containers
