You can use a network address translation (NAT) gateway to **enable instance in a private subnet** to connect to the internet or other AWS services while preventing the internet from initiating a connection with those instances.

## 5 facts to remember NAT Gateways

- Redundant inside the AZ
- Start at 5 Gbps and scales currently to 45 Gbps
- No need to patch
- Not associated with security groups
- Automatically assigned a public IP address

Scenario

If you have resources in multiple AZ and they share a NAT gateway, in the event the NAT gateway's AZ is down, resources in the other AZ lose internet access

-> To create an AZ-independent architecture, create a NAT gateway in each AZ and configure your routing to ensure resources use the NAT gateway in the same AZ
