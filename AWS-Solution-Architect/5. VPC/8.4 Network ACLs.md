[[VPC]]

Network ACL (Access control list) is the first line of defense. This is an option layer of security that acts as a firewall for controlling traffic

- VPC comes with a default network ACL, allow all outbound and inbound traffic
- Create a custom ACL, default will deny all the traffic until adding rule
- Each subnet in VPC must be associated with a network ACL. 
- We use network ACL to block IP address, not security group.
**Network ACLs are stateless**


- You can associate a network ACL with multiple subnets but a subnet can be associated with **only 1 network ACL**
- Network ACL contain a numbered list of rules
- Network ACL have separate inbound and outbound rule
