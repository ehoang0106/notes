### `Printf`

`%v` is a default in `Printf`
`%q` is for a quote
`%T` is for type of the variable
`%f` is for float number

```go
package main
import "fmt"

var age = "45"
var name = "Khoa"

fmt.Printf("my name is %v and i am %v years old", name, age)
//return my name is Khoa and i am 45 years old

fmt.Printf("my name is %q and i am %q years old", name, age)
//return my name is "Khoa" and i am "45" years old

fmt.Printf("age is of type %T", age)
//return age is of type int

fmt.Printf("your score %0.1f points", 225.55)
//return your score is 225.6
```

### `Sprintf` (save formatted strings)

```go
var str = fmt.Sprintf("my name is %v and i am %v years old", name, age)

fmt.Println("the saved string is: ", str)
//return my name is....
```
