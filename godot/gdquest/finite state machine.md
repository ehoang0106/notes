Finite State Machine is a way to organize the code by breaking it down into separate states. 

Each state has own code and behavior, and the machine can only be in one state at the time. 

There 4 conditions for talking about state machine:
- There is a fixed set of states
- The machine can be in one state at a time
- The machine receives even like inputs or signals
- The states have transitions mapped to events. When a state receives a given event, it tells the machine to transition to the corresponding state.
